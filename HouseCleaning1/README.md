# House cleaning 1

## The company structure

In this example, [Harry](src/main/java/dja/housecleaning/Harry.java) is a one person company. 

He owns a van and some cleaning tools and supplies and he does everything himself, from talks to customers through actual cleaning to bookkeeping.  

## The PROs 

It's super simple. Harry is self sufficient. If something needs to change in the future, it's Harry. It's also convenient as there there is no clear distinction between Harry the person and Harry the company. So, for example, Harry can borrow his van and tools to his friends.

## The CONs

This is not sustainable long term. If the company grows Harry would not be able to do everything by himself. Furthermore Harry is mixing company and personal activities. For example, if he borrows the van to a friend, his company is not functioning.
